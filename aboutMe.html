        I like listening to music , walking in nature and watching the rain. Drinking coffee is a pleasure for me and a piece of chocolate with it would be nice. Reading is one of my hobbies. Although I usually read personal development books, I can also prefer to read novels when I find time.

        I don't like the songs that i don't know the lyrics. 
        Lyrics are important to me because I believe these words affect us, our environment and our lives. I believe that beautiful words add beauty to our lives.

        Even though I'm a physicist, I like to write code and I   want to be a web developer. I like to improve myself. I may be a bit of a perfectionist, but discipline is good. I think this is an advantage for me to reach my goals.
